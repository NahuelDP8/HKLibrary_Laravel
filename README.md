The application was developed using the **Laravel** framework for **PHP**. The user interface was built using **Blade** templating engine, complemented with **TailwindCSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**.
 
For saving data and images, the project utilizes a 
database created using **Postgres** and hosted on **Supabase** and an image storage provided by **Cloudinary**. In addition, the application integrates with **Mercado Pago**'s payment service to generate invoices for purchases confirmed through the frontend.

**Vercel** was used to deploy and host the application.
